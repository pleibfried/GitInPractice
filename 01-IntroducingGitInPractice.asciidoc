This is the file GitInPractice.asciidoc
It does not have any use except that it has some contents that can be changed.
The contents itself is bogus and irrelevant.

== Chapter 1 ==
This is the first chapter, containing some text or other - it doesn't really matter, you know.

== Chapter 2 ==
Here we begin another chapter of ultimately pointless drivel :-)

== Chapter 3 ==
This chapter is only for demo purposes (as are all the others, by the way)

== Chapter 4 ==
Another so-called chapter, you get the idea ...
